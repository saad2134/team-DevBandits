## 🎯 Problem Statement

Internships, hackathons, research openings, and scholarships are scattered across a dozen platforms and notice boards. Students either find out too late, apply for things they are underqualified for, or miss opportunities entirely because no one pointed them in the right direction.

### Description:
Build an AI agent that maintains a profile for each student covering skills, CGPA, year, branch, and goals, and scans opportunity platforms in the background. It filters and ranks results against the student profile and delivers a daily shortlist tailored to them. When a student opens a listing, the agent audits their resume against it and drafts a cover letter or cold email. Over time it learns what the student actually engages with and adjusts accordingly.
